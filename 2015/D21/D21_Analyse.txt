Following Nomenclature is used:
Me_Damage: my Damage
Me_Armor: my Armor
Boss_Damage: Boss Damage = 8 (Problem Input)
Boss_Armor: Boss Armor = 2 (Problem Input)

Maximum Damage Possible = 8 (Greataxe) + 3 (Damage +3) + 2 (Damage +2) = 13
Maximum Armor Possible = 5 (Armor) + 3 (Armor +3) + 2 (Armor +2) = 10

Part 1
-------
For me to win the difference 

Me_Damage - Boss_Armor >= Boss_Damage - Me_Armor
=> Me_Damage - 2 >= 8 - Me_Armor

Following Combinations are possible: (Since, we want to mimize Costs)
Me_Armor	Me_Damage 	Min_Amt_Armor	Min_Amt_Damage
0			10			0				115					115
1			9			13				90					103
2			8			31				65					96
3			7			51				40					91		
4			6			73				25					98
5			5			93				10					103
6			4			115				8					123

Since one of the Weapons is mandatory, we will always have atleast 4 damage. 
We remove all where Me_Damage < 4.

So the minimum is 91

Part 2
-------
Dagger = 4, Effective Damage = 2, Max Armor = 5
Dagger = 5, Effective Damage = 3, Max Armor = 4
Dagger = 6, Effective Damage = 4, Max Armor = 3
Dagger = 7, Effective Damage = 5, Max Armor = 2
Dagger = 8, Effective Damage = 6, Max Armor = 1
Dagger = 9, Effective Damage = 7, Max Armor = 0
MaxCost = Dagger + Ring Damage +3 + Ring Damage +2 = 158
This is the maximum
